	<Unicode>chieﬂy haunts the borders of woods, parks, plantations, shrubberies, gardens, and
dense hedgerows; but in the winter it may often be seen feeding in company with
Sparrows, Chaﬃnches, and Buntings, in stubble-ﬁelds, farms, and gardens. Except-
ing when feeding its young, the song may frequently be heard; it is always bright
and clear, and some individuals sing remarkably well, reminding one somewhat of
a Norwich Canary; only, unfortunately the song is always interrupted at the end
of a phrase or two by a harsh zshweer, and terminated with the same disagreeable
note. The call-note is a sound like tirri, or a shrill sharp chirp, somewhat resemb-
ling the chink of the Chaﬃnch; the call of deﬁance is the same as the harsh note
introduced into its song; the call of the young for food resembles that of many
Finches—chiwi or chirri.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest is very frequently placed in hawthorn hedges; indeed I once found
three nests of this bird within a distance of two yards, two of them being only a
foot apart, and all three at a height of about ﬁve feet from the ground; it is also
commonly placed in clumps of tall furze-bushes; I have also found it in laurus-
tinus bushes, in ivy on walls, in the forks of low trees, chieﬂy yews and spruce-ﬁrs,
and a friend found me a nest among the twigs sprouting from the stump of a
branch, cut from a tall oak (about eight feet from the ground) this being placed
at a greater elevation than any other nest of the species which I have met with;
Seebohm, however, speaks of the Greenﬁnch sometimes selecting a site “ﬁfty feet
or more from the ground, in a fork of an elm, or even in a cavity in the trunk.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest varies considerably, the thickness of the walls being from one to
two inches, and usually very ﬁrmly, though occasionally loosely constructed; the
depth of some nests is also double that of others; as regards materials I
cannot do better than quote my own descriptions of eight selected nests from my
“Handbook of British Oology”;—“1.—An outer framework of rough twigs and
coarse roots, the walls of ﬁne roots and green moss, and the lining of ﬁne reddish
ﬁbrous roots. 2.—Of coarse, half-decayed straws, bents, and roots, thickly lined
with ﬁne root-ﬁbre. 3.—Of slender withered grass-straws, and a mass of
greyish wool, felted together, and lined with a few black horse-hairs. 4.—
Of sticks, roots, and moss externally; of wool, vegetable ﬁbre, and less moss,
inwardly, lined with a few black horse-hairs. 5.—Of coarse plaited roots
externally; of ﬁner roots, moss, slender white hairs, and a little wool, matted
together inwardly, and lined with a few black horse-hairs. 6.—Of green moss,
with a few twigs and roots, and thickly lined with cocoanut ﬁbre and a few black
hairs. 7.—Loosely constructed of green moss and spiders' webs, with a few twigs;
lined with vegetable ﬁbre, and a few black hairs. 8.—Of twice the usual depth,
(like a nest within a nest) formed of green moss, wool, and ﬁbrous roots, in patches,</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
