	<Unicode>The Tree-Sparrow is a more active sprightly bird than its commoner relative;
and, although it can hardly be said to have a song,* its chirruping is somewhat
more melodious, its chirp is sharper, and the indignant utterance of a recently
captured bird is shriller.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Although the Tree-Sparrow does not breed so continuously as the House-
Sparrow, which in mild seasons appears to rear family after family throughout the
greater part of the year, there is no doubt that it frequently produces three broods
in a season. When feeding its young it eats caterpillars, spiders, and various
kinds of insects, as well as leaves and unripe seeds of weeds; but at other times
it appears to conﬁne its attentions principally to diﬀerent kinds of seeds.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>On several occasions bird-catchers have oﬀered me Tree-Sparrows at from
twopence to threepence apiece; but the birds looked so vindictive and chirped so
savagely that, considering their powerful beaks, I decided not to risk associating
them with the other members of my feathered family. Although opinions diﬀer
greatly respecting the character of this species, I am satisﬁed that I adopted the
safest course. Stevenson (Birds of Norfolk, Vol. I, p. 209) says:—“In conﬁnement
the Tree-Sparrows are certainly the shyest and most untameable of any birds I
have ever introduced into my aviary, and even time seems to work but little change
in their wild nature, as on the approach of any person, whether a stranger or not,
they dash about the cage in a reckless manner, and when exhausted and panting
with fright, will creep into any corner or dark spot to escape notice.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>* The late Rev. H. A Macpherson assured me that the Tree-Sparrow has a very sweet song; a fact
vouched for independently by Mr. J. Whitaker and the late Edward Blyth. In 1906 a friend (Mr. Allen Silver)
gave me a pair, and I have been looking forward ever since to the pleasure of hearing this ”sweet song,”
but up to the present time only an ordinary sharp chirp has been uttered: I ﬁnd them, as Stevenson did,
exceedingly wild and tempestuous birds.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
