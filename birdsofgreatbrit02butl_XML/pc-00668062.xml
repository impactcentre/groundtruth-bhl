	<Unicode>Kent; and even after Mr. Bidwell had recognized in my collection a clutch of
eggs of this species, which I had taken at Iwade, near Sheppy, on June 5th, 1877,
as being unquestionably those of E. cirlus (a fact which, I believe, I promptly
recorded in the “Zoologist”) the same statement was repeated, until the appear-
ance of Howard Saunders’ Manual in 1888. It has, however, been found breeding
as far northward as Yorkshire, but it is of accidental occurrence at any season
either in the midlands or the northern counties.* In Scotland it has occurred as
a chance straggler, but its recorded occurrence in Ireland was formerly questioned.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The adult male Cirl Bunting has the crown and nape olive-green, longitudinally
streaked with dull black; the rump and upper tail-coverts olivaceous; the sides
of the head blackish-olive, with a lemon-yellow stripe above, and a second below
the eye, from the base of the beak to the neck; the chin and throat to the sides
of the neck dull black, bounded by a half collar of lemon-yellow; across the chest
is a greyish-olive belt; sides and ﬂanks chestnut, narrowly streaked with black;
remainder of under parts lemon-yellow: in other respects this species nearly
resembles the Yellow Bunting, the back, wings, and tail being very similar; the
beak is dark horn-brown above, but paler and bluish below; the feet yellowish-
horn; the iris hazel. The female is much duller, and chieﬂy diﬀers from that
sex of the Yellow Hammer in the absence of yellow on the crown, and the
olivaceous rump; the yellow of the under parts is also not so bright, and the
streaking is better deﬁned. Young birds nearly resemble the female, but are still
duller. The male, after the autumn moult, has ashy fringes to the black feathers
of the throat, which, however, disappear in the spring.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>In disposition the Cirl Bunting appears to nearly resemble the Yellow Ham‐
mer; but during the breeding season it is evidently somewhat more skulking, for
although I have frequently heard it singing in the hedges and in rough scrub, in
the lanes and little frequented roads of Kent, I have very rarely seen the per‐
formers: even in an aviary I found it at all seasons much more shy and retiring.
I should, therefore, be inclined to think that an example mentioned by Lord Lilford
(Birds of Northamptonshire, Vol. I, p. 176) must have escaped from conﬁnement,
after some years of captivity in an aviary. He says:—“as I was watching my
Emus and other birds in the courtyard at Lilford, a ﬁne male Cirl Bunting ﬂew
down from a high elm tree, settled on the ground within a few yards of where I
stood, and began feeding on the grain which had been scattered for the Emus, and</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>* In the “Zoologist” for 1891, p. 353, Mr. E. A. Swainson records its occurrence in Cardiganshire, and
observes:—“This species, which has in the last two years become rather common in parts of the adjoining
county of Brecon, where it was previously very rare, appears to be gradually extending its range westwards.
It is said to be not uncommon locally in Denbigh and Flint, and round the mouth of the river Conway. In
Ireland a male was watched and its note heard in Donegal in 1902.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
