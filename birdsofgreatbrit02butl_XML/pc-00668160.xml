	<Unicode>Lord Lilford (“Birds of Northamptonshire,” Vol. I, pp. 212-213) observes:—
“We have had many opportunities of closely observing the habits of this
eminently sagacious bird in various parts of the world, and, in spite of his
tendencies to murder, assault, and robbery, we must confess to a great liking for
him. The Raven is in this county a very early breeder, generally selecting a
secure ledge in a cliﬀ, more rarely a tall tree, and returning to the same locality
for nesting year after year. The young birds often leave the nest during the
ﬁrst fortnight of March, sometimes before that date. We have more than once
heard of a full complement of eggs early in February, and, on the other hand,
found unﬂedged young in more than one Raven’s nest as late as the middle of
May. The old birds are always wary, one always keeping a close look-out whilst
the other is on the nest, and immediately uttering a warning note on the
approach of danger. We have heard of Ravens vigorously attacking persons
attempting to harm their nests, but have never witnessed anything of the sort,
our experience being to the eﬀect that, during the siege, the parent birds usually
soar high in air over the nest, uttering, besides their usual croak of alarm or
anger, a curious sound, like the noise made by drawing a tightly ﬁtting cork
from a bottle, occasionally turning complete somersaults in the air, and making
ferocious stoops in the direction of the invader, but always keeping well out of
gunshot-range. For some time after the young Ravens leave the nest they roam
in company with their parents, but soon separate and start oﬀ singly or in
couples on marauding expeditions on their own account.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Although not strictly speaking a gregarious species, this bird when attracted
by food often assembles in considerable numbers; when approaching a carcass it
does not ﬂy directly to it, but alights at a short distance and approaches it
warily with heavy ungainly hops. Upon the wing it ﬂaps heavily, but its ﬂight,
nevertheless, is powerful and tolerably rapid.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest of the Raven is always bulky, though more so when built on
ledges of rocks than when placed in trees; it consists of sticks, twigs, heather-
stems, and sometimes a tangle of sheep’s wool. The lining is of roots, grass,
wool, fur, or other soft materials. The eggs number from four to six, frequently
ﬁve; in ground-colour they usually vary from greenish-blue to olive-greenish,
more or less densely marked with deep olive-brown, the shell markings appearing
frequently like smears or faint patches of the same colour (as if partly washed
out); the pattern and character of the markings vary much as usual, sometimes
the streaks and blotches are few and large, sometimes they are mingled with
numerous smaller markings, sometimes again the small spots are so close together
as to give a diﬀerent tone to the egg; the depth of the markings also varies</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
