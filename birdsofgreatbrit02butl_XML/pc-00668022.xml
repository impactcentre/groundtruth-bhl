	<Unicode>The fully adult male Chaﬃnch in breeding plumage has the forehead velvety
black, the crown and nape steel blue, the former sometimes tinged with green, the
latter somewhat ashy; the mantle bright chestnut; lower back bluish ash-grey at
base of feathers, sap-green at tips, changing to bright sap-green on the rump and
upper tail-coverts; lesser and median wing-coverts white; greater coverts black
tipped with white; quills smoky-brown, with narrow dull yellow edges to the
outer webs; two central tail-feathers smoky-brown, remaining feathers blue-black;
the two outer feathers with broad wedge-shaped white patches, that ou the outer‐
most one occupying fully half the feather; sides of head, throat, breast, and front
of belly vinous-chestnut, lower belly and ﬂanks somewhat duller and greyer; under
tail-coverts white; beak leaden-blackish, paler beneath; feet dull brown; iris
hazel. After the autumn moult the feathers of the crown have brownish edges,
the under parts are slightly paler and the beak is ﬂesh-brown, with dark tip. The
female has the crown and back buﬃsh-brown, and the under parts buﬃsh-grey; it
also appears to be slightly smaller than the male. The young in ﬁrst plumage
are similar to the female, but rather paler: in the ﬁrst year they do not attain
their full beauty, the crown being brownish with two dusky longitudinal stripes;
indeed the full sheeny lustre is not acquired until about the third year; the
median wing-coverts also are more exposed in old birds, making the white belt
across the wing broader.*</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Pied examples of the Chaﬃnch are not very rare, and the white in the
plumage certainly increases with age. I caught one in my garden many years
ago, and exhibited it for two years running at the Crystal Palace Bird Show. A
second bird presented to me about 1904, developed a white spot on the nape which
increased in size with each successive moult.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Like the British Buntings, the Chaﬃnch both runs and hops; on the ground
it almost invariably either runs or walks; also during the summer months it is
almost exclusively insectivorous; like the Buntings again, it accustoms its young
to taking food from its beak at a much earlier age than do the other typical
Finches: its position, therefore, should certainly be at the end of the Subfamily of
which it is the type, and immediately before the Emberizinœ. It has even been
asserted that the Chaﬃnch pairs on the wing, but this fable is based upon its
violent and impetuous courtship, in which respect it corresponds with the members
of the New World genus Sycalis, both sexes sometimes falling to the earth strug-</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>* I have not seen these points noted in any description, indeed they may pass for variations to those
who have not reared Chaﬃnches from the nest; they are also overlooked by judges at shows, who often give
a prize to birds of the year (not in full adult colouring).</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
