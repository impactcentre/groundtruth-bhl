	<Unicode>building like them (sic), but by holes in the outside”; whilst Howard Saunders
mentions its building “beneath the tiles of roofs, as well as under the coping of
old walls and in sea-cliﬀs”; I have taken it from a hole in a ruined lime-kiln;
and, in the “Zoologist” for 1887, p. 265, I recorded the fact of my ﬁnding a
nest with six perfectly typical eggs (on May 24th) in an exposed mole-burrow in
a brick-earth cutting at Kemsley, near Sheppy. Nidiﬁcation lasts from May to
August, nests being most abundant in the latter half of May.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest is usually bag-shaped, consisting of a mere thick lining to the hole
in which it is situated; the top being widely open, so that the light generally
falls directly upon the eggs; the materials are similar to those used by the
Common Sparrow—straw, hay, and a mass of poultry-feathers. The eggs number
from four to six; they are rather smaller than those of the House-Sparrow, and
vary nearly as much (perhaps quite as much, if one could obtain a suﬃcient series
to decide the point); I have taken them greenish-white, with scarcely perceptible
grey speckling; greenish-white, speckled with grey, spotted with two shades of
sepia, sometimes with the heaviest markings in a subterminal zone; somewhat
greyer, mottled and streaked with grey (not unlike an egg of the Pied Wagtail);
greyish-white, thickly mottled and blotched with grey, most densely at the larger
end, also with one or two blackish dots (not unlike a Titlark’s egg); dull white,
heavily blotched and streaked with vandyke-brown in two shades, and with small
grey shell-spots; similar, but so densely streaked and splashed with brown as
almost to hide the ground-colour; lastly rufous-brown, speckled and streaked,
especially at the larger end, with darker brown (resembling a reddish variety of
the Tree-Pipit). The darker and more ruddy eggs are most characteristic of the
species; but most of those which I obtained from Kentish nests were of the lighter
varieties, though the eggs in one clutch sometimes exhibit considerable modiﬁcation
in this respect. It is possible that the colouring of the eggs may have a local
signiﬁcance, inasmuch as Lord Lilford’s experience in Northamptonshire led him
to the conclusion that the ground-colour, as a rule, was lighter than in eggs of
the House-Sparrow; whilst those which I obtained in Norfolk were usually
remarkable for their darker ground-tint, although exceptions did occur.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>It seems to me more probable that light in some way aﬀects the colouring of
eggs; inasmuch as, not only are most eggs which are laid in the dark pure white,
but all those which I have found in heavily shaded positions have been pale and
little marked, in comparison with those exposed to direct daylight; the lightest
eggs of the Tree-Sparrow which I obtained in Norfolk were those taken from the
horizontal branch of a willow, where the light only entered imperfectly over one
side of the nest-cavity; those in the top of the stump, which were fully exposed</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
