	<Unicode>dark brown at the tip of the upper mandible; feet blackish-brown; iris hazel.
The female is slightly smaller than the male, with a broader crown; upper parts
slightly darker; rump and breast without rose-red colouration; the under parts
also somewhat more streaked than in the male. The young nearly resemble the
female, but have no red on the crown. After the autumn moult the rose-colouring
disappears, but towards the spring it gradually reappears in the feathers without
a moult: this reproduction of bright colouring does not, however, take place in
caged Redpolls, but, where they are conﬁned in large well-ventilated sunny aviaries,
it does in the ﬁrst season.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>In its habits, haunts, food, and song, the Lesser Redpoll nearly resembles
the Mealy type: its nest, which is placed in the fork of a tree, a hawthorn, or
gooseberry bush, a hedge, or a large grass tussock, usually near water, is not
unlike a small, neatly formed, and very softly lined Linnet’s nest; it is ﬁrmly
constructed of plant-stalks, roots, moss, and dry-grass, with hair towards the
interior; the lining consisting of pure white willow-down, wool or occasionally
very ﬁne grasses and feathers. The eggs, which number from four to six, are
either pale blue, or bluish-white, with dark purplish-brown surface spots, and
sometimes short linear dashes and underlying blood-red spots and speckles; some
eggs are spotted nearly all over, and others principally at the larger end, an
imperfect zone of spots is often present at this extremity: there is considerable
variation in size.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>I have not only seen and heard the Lesser Redpoll in Kent during the breeding
season, but have on several occasions ﬂushed the hen bird from her nest; twice
I obtained the nest with six eggs from grass-tussocks growing upon narrow foot‐
paths through marsh and pools of water, at Murston,* and once from a hawthorn
bush on marshy land, at Kemsley; the last-mentioned nest was less ﬁrm than
usual, though compact, the body of it being formed almost entirely of wool, with
an outer thin framework of dried grass and an inner lining of hair.†</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

so much injured in the attempt to blow them, that I did not preserve them: one egg of the second nest also
burst, but I saved the remainder.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>† Mr. Wharton (“Zoologist,” p. 8951) also records the discovery of the nest of the Lesser Redpoll in Kent;
and many others have, since then, recorded its abundance as a nesting species in this county. In the
“Zoologist” for 1887, p. 428, Mr. Joseph Vine states that he found two very young birds of this species,
dead, but quite fresh, at Highgate, in September. One of these nestlings was taken in the ﬂesh to the Rev.
H. A. Macpherson, for identiﬁcation. He told me that it could almost have ﬂown, and had probably
ﬂuttered out of the nest when alarmed by some marauder.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
