	<Unicode>The song of the Yellow Bunting is not especially meritorious, though bright
and cheering; it consists of a rapid descending scale made up of a repetition of
a sharp note which may be rendered chip or chink, and terminating with a double
note chee-chee: it rather suggests the shaking up of shillings between the hands,
and has been likened to the words “Give me a little bit of bread and no cheese,”
though “green cheese” would have been a better interpretation: occasionally the
double note is omitted; but more especially when the bird is beginning to sing
in the early spring. Being a late breeder this species continues his song well
into the autumn, and often recommences in February. The male call-note is
described as chich, chich, churr.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nidiﬁcation of this bird commences about the middle of April, and not
unfrequently continues up to the end of August: I have myself taken a nest as
late as the 12th August with three fresh eggs (Vide “Zoologist” for December,
1883) and eggs have been obtained in September.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest is usually placed low down, though occasionally at a distance of from
four to ﬁve feet above the ground in a hedge, and (according to Howard Saunders)
exceptionally at a height of seven feet. I have often found it in low bushes, but
only once in furze; in low scrub on partially cleared waste ground; in holes in
grassy banks by the road-side; or under a low dividing hedge between ﬁelds; also
at a considerable height (from thirty to forty feet) in a niche in the side of a
gravel or chalk-pit surrounded by tufts of plantain and grass. The structure is a
loose one, occasionally so much so that, when taken, the outer walls have to be
supported to prevent their falling apart; these consist of coarse straws, dead
grasses, and sometimes a few twigs interlaced; and, in one nest which I took
from a hedge, there was an edging of dead chestnut leaves; the lining consists of
ﬁne withered grass-bents, and a few rootlets and horsehairs.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The eggs of the Yellow Hammer are extremely variable, both in ground-tint
and marking, although most of them exhibit the purplish-black characters which
have earned for this bird the title of “Scribbling Lark.” In tint they vary from
greenish-white, through greyish-lavender, to pale rosy-brownish; whilst one egg,
taken by my brother Frank, in Cornwall, was bright sienna-red, with a single
irregular blackish line across one side, and somewhat resembles a rare form of
the egg of the Tree-Pipit (Plate III, ﬁg. 100). On two occasions I have taken
the greenish-white egg almost or entirely without markings, the ﬁrst time I only
secured the ﬁrst egg (as I had to return to town the following day) on the second
occasion I obtained a clutch of three; four elliptical eggs in one clutch were dull</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
