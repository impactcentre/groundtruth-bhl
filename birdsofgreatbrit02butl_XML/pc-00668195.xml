	<Unicode>therein is an advantage; the young birds at ﬁrst sleep in the nest, but as they
get older they crouch down on the turf, and the moist warmth seems to lessen the
tendency to cramp; but I am sure that another and a more important thing is to
give them food containing plenty of egg and moistened ants' cocoons. When
adult, two or three mealworms a day, a handful of canary and millet-seed once a
week, and watercress when obtainable, should be given in addition to the usual
soft food.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>I think it was in the winter of 1891-2 that my man, having nothing else to
do, took my nets out and brought me home thirteen Sky-Larks, in addition to a
few other birds; about eight of these proved to be cock birds, and I selected the
three best singers as cage-birds; one of these I ﬁnally retained, parting with the
remainder to friends. This bird was always tame and healthy: he lived in a two
foot “runner,” half turfed and half sanded; he was a grand singer, producing the
wild song so perfectly, that if you shut your eyes you could imagine his upward
ﬂight, and ﬁnally his dropping notes as he returned to earth. Towards the end
of 1895 he failed to get well through his moult, and one morning I found him
dead with his head under his wing.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Mr. Seebohm's account of the migration of Sky-Larks as observed by him in
Heligoland is exceedingly interesting; but unfortunately I have not space to quote
it here. Speaking of the complaints respecting the diminution of birds, Herr
Gätke says:—“To a witness, however, of the enormous passage of migrants, of
the myriads of individuals which on autumn nights travel past this island, like
the ﬂakes of a snow-storm, not only within the area of the lighthouse, but for
miles north and south out to sea, these complaints seem quite incomprehensible.
It is surely impossible that the hand of man can exercise any perceptible inﬂuence
on such enormous migration streams”; and he adds that the number of 15,000
Larks caught in one autumn night does not approximately express a proportion
of one for each 10,000 individuals of such a migrant stream.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
