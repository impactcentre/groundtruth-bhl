	<Unicode>The song of the Cirl Bunting diﬀers from that of the Yellow Hammer chieﬂy
in the absence of the terminal double note; it has, therefore, been compared with
that of the Lesser Redpoll and Lesser Whitethroat. The call-note of the young
and adult are said by the late Mr. Witchell to be “not unlike the call-squeak of
the Tree Pipit”; according to Seebohm the adult call-note “sounds like a
monotonous and plaintive chea-che.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Subsequent to taking my ﬁrst nest of the Cirl Bunting in 1877, I frequently
heard and occasionally saw the cock-bird in the same neighbourhood, but I did
not obtain a nest again till 1884, when I found two at Tunstall, the ﬁrst on the
24th and the second on the 30th of May: four years later I obtained permission
to nest in some private grounds near Frinstead, in Kent, and on the 26th May I
took my fourth and last nest of this species.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The Cirl Bunting appears to be double-brooded, the ﬁrst nest being usually
built some time in May, and the second in July. The sites chosen for the nest
are very similar to those selected by the Yellow Bunting: according to Howard
Saunders who found it not uncommon on the chalk-hills of Surrey, it “is placed
in a bank among the stems of a hazel or other bush, though sometimes in furze,
or juniper, at a little distance from the ground.” My nests were all found within
a foot or two above the earth, the ﬁrst in a stunted furze-bush tangled with a
blackberry vine, two others in low juniper scrub overrun with bramble, and the
fourth in a young hawthorn bush.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The nest is tolerably compact internally, though externally somewhat loosely
put together, the outer wall usually consisting of coarse dead grass, bents, and
vegetable ﬁbre; the lining of ﬁne ﬁbre and black horse-hair; occasionally a little
moss is said to be used in the lining; but this material is rarely used by any of
the British Buntings. The eggs number from four to ﬁve (my nests contained
respectively four, four, three, and two eggs) and are often somewhat broader than
those of the Yellow Hammer, they are white, generally very faintly tinged with
lilac; streaked, spotted, and dotted with purplish-black, especially towards the
larger end; with small, and frequently indistinct lilacine-greyish shell-spots. The
markings often terminate in round blots; and, occasionally, some of the streaks
are chocolate. Seebohm describes an abnormal nest in his collection as “somewhat
loosely put together, and made externally of various plant-stems, blades of grass,</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>* Howard Saunders observes that in snowy weather, in the south of France, he has seen small ﬂocks
feeding along with Sparrows and other Finches, on the refuse in the streets, but Lord Lilford's bird was noticed
at the end of June, when one would have expected it to be shy.—A.G.B.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
