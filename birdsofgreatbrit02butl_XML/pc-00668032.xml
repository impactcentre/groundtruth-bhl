	<Unicode>frequently indistinguishable from those of the Chaﬃnch; but usually they are
decidedly greener, with smaller and less deﬁned markings; a hen Brambling
formerly in my possession, which must have been taken as a cage-bird to South
America and liberated there (I picked her out of a batch of newly imported
Brazilian Birds) occasionally used to drop an egg from the branch on which she
roosted; these eggs were greenish-blue, like those of a Hedge-Accentor, but with
four or ﬁve deep brown spots on sienna-reddish smears towards the larger end;
of course they were always broken when I found them.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Like the Chaﬃnch, this species feeds largely on insects in the summer time,
and on various kinds of seed in the winter, it is especially fond of beech-mast,
but also eats the seeds of many noxious weeds, and fruit. On the ground it both
runs and hops, but chieﬂy the former.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The call-note is usually described as a harsh chirp, probably referring to the
grating zshweeo which it utters (in common with the Greenﬁnch, the Baya and
Manyar Weavers, and many other birds); if so I have no hesitation in asserting
positively that this is its note of deﬁance, inasmuch as it not only utters it after
its song, but when disputing with another bird. I suspect the true call-note to
be a sharp whit. The alarm-note according to Seebohm is a hurried ziv, ziv, but
I have not heard this note from any of the birds which I have kept. The song,
which I have frequently heard sung by two of my male Bramblings, is very like
that of the Chaﬃnch without the terminal notes; as, however, it is generally
followed, almost immediately, by the harsh cry of deﬁance, it would almost seem
as if this might represent the wheat-ear or lissi-ear of that species. The scale of
the Brambling is rather shorter than in the song of the Chaﬃnch, and delivered
with less vehemence; but in this respect individuals may diﬀer.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>A pair of Bramblings formed part of the little collection with which I com‐
menced my studies in aviculture: I kept them with a pair of Goldﬁnches, a Hedge-
Accentor, and one or two other birds, in a large home-made ﬂight cage. These
were the worst-tempered Bramblings I ever had, they disputed incessantly, and at
ﬁrst gave the hen Goldﬁnch a wretched time of it, viciously pecking her whenever
she went down to feed near them; but one day the cock Brambling made a mis‐
take and pecked the male Goldﬁnch, which simply sprang at him, grasped his body
with its claws, and tore a bunch of feathers from his breast. After this both
Goldﬁnches were let alone, but the male and female Bramblings fought incessantly,
the hen eventually pecking out one of her husband’s eyes, soon after which he died:
curiously enough she only survived him a few days.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
