	<Unicode>and every day the woman removed them, and, at the end of the week, placed a
stone on the ledge, which eﬀectually baﬄed the Flycatcher’s eﬀorts at that spot;
but the bird then began building at the latter end of the ledge, from whence it
was also driven, and three stones being then placed on the ledge, the bird relin‐
quished the attempt to build at either end of it, and commenced building a nest
on a beech-tree opposite, which it completed, and laid two eggs in it. When the
bird was thus apparently established in the beech-tree, the stones over the door
were taken away, when the Flycatcher immediately forsook its nest and eggs in
the beech, and again commenced building over the door on the part of the pro‐
jecting ledge, which it had ﬁrst chosen. The nest was again destroyed, and two
slates placed over the spot; the bird contrived to throw down one of the slates
from a slanting to a horizontal position, and then began to build upon it. The
nest was again destroyed, and the three stones replaced and kept there a fortnight,
after which they were again removed, and, directly they were taken away, the bird
again began building. The nest was subsequently destroyed several times in
succession; the bird was twice driven away by a towel being thrown at it; a stone
wrapped in white paper was placed on the ledge to intimidate it, but the Flycatcher
still persevered, completed a nest, and laid an egg. On hearing the circumstances
I directed that the persecution of the poor bird should cease, after which it laid
two more eggs, hatched all three, and successfully brought oﬀ its brood.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Some years since a young Spotted Flycatcher was brought to me; it had
ﬂown against a lamp, was temporarily stunned, and a lad picked it up without
diﬃculty. I tried to keep it, but it refused to feed, as most birds do after they
have left the nest, and, although I forced it to eat, it died the next day: perhaps
I lost nothing by the death of this bird; for the Flycatchers are not especially
suited to cage or aviary life, are neither attractive in plumage or song, and are
said to be delicate and diﬃcult to keep in health. If reared from the nest they
would doubtless eat the usual soft food, but I should expect them to follow the
example of the Hirundinidœ, eat to repletion and take little exercise. They have
been kept, but it may be questioned whether it is worth the trouble.*</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
