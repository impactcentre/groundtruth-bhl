	<Unicode>about the possession of a nut, for the cock often tried to rob his mate, and she
made every endeavour to retain her tit-bit, squeaking in a low key. It was on
the 19th of February that I ﬁrst saw the male Nutcracker feeding his mate: she
ﬂuttered her wings all the time, and cried as a young bird might have done.
Thereafter the relations of these birds became most intimate. I tried my best to
induce them to nest in the aviary, but they could not make up their minds to
breed in conﬁnement.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>Unfortunately, my health broke down completely in the spring of 1893: I
was obliged to leave my birds to the care of a friend. When I returned to duty
in the following September I found my birds newly dead, to my great regret.
The female had died from moulting troubles. It was thought that her faithful
mate had died of grief, as he pined away from the day of her decease.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The late Lord Lilford informed me in 1893, that he had kept a number of
Nutcrackers in conﬁnement. He said that his birds were specially fond of hazel‐
nuts and walnuts. They were supplied also with ‘every other variety of nut and
berries that could be procured—hips, haws, peas, beans, acorns, blackberries,
beech-mast, cones of spruce, boiled rice, stale bread-crumbs, hard-boiled egg, now
and then a little boiled liver, beetles, earthworms and crushed hemp-seed. The
latter was mixed with dried ants’ eggs.’ I must say that my birds declined to
eat anything except nuts; but I was away on sick-leave during the months in
which their diet would naturally have varied most.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The late Mr. John Hancock kept a specimen of the Nutcracker in conﬁnement
for six years. ‘Its voice was very peculiar. It had an extremely harsh, loud
cry, resembling the noise produced by a ripping saw while in full action. This
cry was so loud that it could be heard all over the house. It had also a sweet,
low, delicate, warbling song. This was only uttered when everything was quiet.’</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>I never heard my male sing. He crowed, with a loud guttural caw, which
was uttered while the bird perched in a drawn, upright position, the mandibles
being visibly extended. He had a low squeaking note of pleasure, and could
address his mate in curious terms of endearment.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
