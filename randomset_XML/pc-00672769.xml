	<Unicode>margins, which are round - edged, and perfectly
smooth. The concentric lines are so slight that they
at ﬁrst sight appear to be more due to colour than to
sculpture; and the character of the epidermis is such
that it resembles a coat of varnish. The animal is
ﬂesh-coloured with a tendency towards orange. The
mantle is slightly scalloped along the lower margin,
and has a few tentacles at the front. The orange
tubes of this species are not united all the way, and
their mouths are fringed with black-tipped tentacles.
The large, thick foot is dark ﬂesh-tinted. It is not
generally distributed, its range in our waters being
conﬁned to the south and west,
where it dwells in sand at
depths between 12 and 25
fathoms. It is a good edible
species, not only for man, but
is also appreciated by ﬁsh and
bird; hence its thick hard
valves, which probably are
needed not only to resist the
jaws and palate teeth of big ﬁshes, but to prevent
injury from rolling about in great commotions of the
lower waters. We have seen it washed up on Cornish
beaches after continued heavy gales, and have seen
the Razor-bills and Puﬃns attack it with their
powerful bills, nipping oﬀ a little of the shell at one
end to admit the point of their beak in order to
sever the adductor muscle which keeps the valves
closed. It is to these muscles and the exceedingly
powerful hinge-teeth that the inviolability of the
shell is due, for there are no cogs along the margins
by which the valves may interlock.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion></Page></PcGts>
