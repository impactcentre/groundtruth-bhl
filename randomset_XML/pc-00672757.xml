	<Unicode>Monro was ordered with his regiment to rein-
force the garrison at lake George. Aware of
the siege that was about to commence, Putnam
advised colonel Monro not to carry his costly
baggage &amp; camp equipage; but Monro,not ap-
prised of the intelligence which had been given
to Webb, disregarded the advice and marched
on without any apprehension of immediate dan-
ger. †</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>THE day after Monro had arrived and taken
the command, the lake appeared to be covered
with boats; and a large army of French and
Indians were swiftly approaching towards the
fort. Montcalm eﬀected a landing with but
little opposition, and immediately began the
siege. A small party of the garrison had a
skirmish with some of the advanced parties of
the enemy, and some that had been taken pris-
oners, had been murdered and scalped by the
Indians with circumstances of the most inhu-
man barbarity. Montcalm wished to avail
himself of this event, and endeavoured to pur-
suade the garrison to an immediate surrender.
On the day in which he invested the place, he
sent a letter to colonel Monro, stating that he
thought himself bound in humanity to urge
him to surrender before any of the Indians were
slain, &amp; their savage temper should be further in-
ﬂamed by a resistance which could not be avail-
ing. “A detachment of your garrison, says
‘ he, has lately experienced their cruelty; I
‘ have it yet in my power to restrain them, and
‘ oblige them to observe a capitulation, as none</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
