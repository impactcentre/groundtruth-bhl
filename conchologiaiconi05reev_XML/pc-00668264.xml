	<Unicode>layer of epidermis becomes saturated, and the ground
colour of the shell is seen through it; as the moisture
evaporates, the epidermis resumes its light appearance.
Sir David Brewster, in reply to a letter from Mr. Broderip
on this subject, says: “It appears to me, from very careful
observations, that the epidermis consists of two layers,
and that it is only the upper layer which is porous
wherever the pattern is white. These white or porous
portions of the epidermis diﬀer from the other parts of
the upper layer only in having been deprived of, or in
never having possessed, the element which gives trans-
parency to the membrane; in the same manner as hydro-
phanous opal has become white, from the expulsion of
its water of crystallization.”</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>There is little variety in the animal of Bulimus: the
Chilian species are mostly of a light colour, and a few in
this and the Columbian district are spotted, some having
a transparent shell through which the spots are visible.
The Philippine species are, without exception, of a sombre
olivaceous brown, and dwell in family groups, as it were,
among the shady foliage of the branches. Out of a group
of some dozen living specimens not more than three or
four may be found in an adult state with the lip of the
shell reﬂected. They may be dislodged by shaking the
branches, but are chieﬂy disturbed by the heavy rains
with which those islands are at times visited. Mr. Cuming
preferred, however, to collect them in dry sunny weather,
because he was sure of ﬁnding the objects of his search in
their shady places of retreat. In the immense sandy tract
on the west side of the Andes, the reverse of this con-
dition of nature prevails. The Bulimi are here physically
very distinct; some reside all the year round upon the
numerous Cacti, but during the dry season, which lasts
for several months, they mostly live in a state of torpor,
inclosed within their shell by an epiphragm, and buried
in the sand or under stones. On the approach of the
dews, they revive to a state of animation, and crawl about
at night in quest of food.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>In illustration of the remarkable drought that prevails
in Northern Chili, and of its eﬀect upon molluscous life,
I am tempted to repeat, in brief, an anecdote related to
me by Mr. Cuming. On the arrival of our friend at the
Port of Copiapo in 1829, he discovered the beautiful
Bulimus Broderipii in considerable numbers, in the ﬁssures
of the rocks that may be seen here and there in the sandy
plains of that country. Finding a large proportion of
them dead, with the soft parts entirely decomposed, he
requested a solitary inhabitant of the place to collect as
many specimens as he could pick out alive whilst he
occupied himself with botanizing. Returning from his</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>excursion, Mr. Cuming was greatly disappointed to ﬁnd
that among the quantity his Chilian collector had accumu-
lated, there was scarcely one in a living state. Upon
remonstrating with him for his inattention, the native
replied: “Only wait till the dews come, and they will be
all alive again.” Mr. Cuming rejoined: “I suppose you
mean when it rains.” The man, however, in perfect aston-
ishment inquired what he meant; though a sexagenarian,
he had never heard of such a thing as rain.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The Bulimi vary in their mode of propagation: fragile
species, with the lip of the shell simple, are mostly vivi-
parous, whilst those with a reﬂected lip are oviparous.
The arboreal species of the Philippines deposit their eggs
in little clusters on the trees, between two leaves which
the animal manages to curl up one upon the other, so as
to form a receptacle for their protection; and, so far as
Mr. Cuming’s observations go, they are all soft like
snake’s eggs, with the single exception of the B. Min-
doroensis, in which instance the eggs are calcareous,
deposited upon the leaf in parallel rows, each standing
perpendicularly on end, attached at the base by a glutinous
substance.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>The habits of the Bulimi in the two widely remote
countries explored by Mr. Cuming, having been treated of
in the foregoing remarks, it only remains to speak of them
in other parts. Turning to New Holland we are unex-
pectedly surprised to ﬁnd that the genus is represented
to an extremely limited extent. I am not aware of more
than three species having been found in this wide expanse
of country, although several ﬁne Helices have been dis-
covered; and in a region of which the Fauna and Flora
exhibit so luxuriant and distinctive a character, the scarcity
of a genus of so much importance in the Eastern Isles is
remarkable. The same observation applies to New Zealand,
from whence, so far as the interior of the islands of that
group has been visited, no more than one or two species
have been received. In Africa the Bulimi are almost
as great strangers as in the localities just spoken of;
throughout the whole extent of land yet explored of this
vast continent, scarcely a dozen species have been ob-
tained. The Bulimi are here replaced by Achatinæ.
Such a phenomenon may also be observed in some of the
islands of the Paciﬁc: in the Sandwich Islands the Bulimi
are replaced by the genus Achatinella, and in the Society
Islands their place is occupied by the Partulæ. In the
West Indies the genera Achatina and Glandina seem to
prevail. Howsoever abundant is the genus Bulimus in
most of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, few
species appear to inhabit the great territories of India and
China. On the coast of Borneo a beautiful species was</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
